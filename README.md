computational biohacking

this is 2 second step in making a software that will automate biohackers work, inculding selectivity calculation of substances

the first step was https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subbind/hdlnkhfddbapfdllojdhlepocncbckkp

now need to do:
-restful API, done/partially!
-sqlite3 db insert, ongoing
-selectivity calculation
-filter
specification: you choose receptors you want to interact with, and the tool search every substance combination it have, to give the best, based on selectivity, affordability (OTC, FDA approved or RC)

MIT, but apple logic as admin, and expected to buy later, and can be enforced, i say something doesn't mean ill do it
