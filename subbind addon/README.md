# clearer substance binding for biohackers 

bindingdb.org is a meta search engine that fetch data from other search engine like PSPP,
i tried to find a easy way to know the median binding of a substance using bindingdb.org but the data was hard to use , so i developed a addon that will scrap the data and give you easy way to know the median binding of any substance  

how to use:  
-select a substance name from any site (eg, wikipedia) then right click and choose "find binding for ****"   
-or click addon icon for specific name search
